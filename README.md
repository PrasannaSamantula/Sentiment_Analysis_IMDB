**IMDB Sentiment Analysis (Mini Project)**

📌 Project Overview
This repository demonstrates a **Sentiment Analysis system** built on **IMDB movie reviews** using Python and Machine Learning.  
The goal is to classify movie reviews as **Positive** or **Negative** based on their textual content.

To keep the project simple and educational, a **small dataset of 15 IMDB reviews** is used as an example to illustrate the complete sentiment analysis pipeline.

🎯 Objectives
- Understand text preprocessing techniques
- Convert text data into numerical features
- Train a machine learning model for sentiment classification
- Predict sentiment for new movie reviews

🧠 Approach & Workflow
1. **Data Collection**
   - A sample dataset of 15 IMDB movie reviews

2. **Text Preprocessing**
   - Lowercasing
   - Removing punctuation
   - Tokenization (handled by vectorizers)

3. **Feature Extraction**
   - Bag of Words (CountVectorizer)  
   - TF-IDF (TfidfVectorizer)

4. **Model Training**
   - Logistic Regression classifier

5. **Prediction**
   - Sentiment prediction on unseen movie reviews

🛠️ Technologies Used
